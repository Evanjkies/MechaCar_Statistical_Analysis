## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and Intercept all had stitistically significant p-values (below .05)
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0. The slope would only be 0 if all of the mpg outputs were based on pure variance/chance.
- The r-squared value of .6825 suggests that our linear model fits roughly 68% of the data. This model is a decent predictor of mpg in the prototypes, but a higher r-squared value would be more desireable

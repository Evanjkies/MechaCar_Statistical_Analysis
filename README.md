# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and Intercept all had stitistically significant p-values (below .05)
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0. The slope would only be 0 if all of the mpg outputs were based on pure variance/chance.
- The r-squared value of .6825 suggests that our linear model fits roughly 68% of the data. This model is a decent predictor of mpg in the prototypes, but a higher r-squared value would be more desireable

## Summary Statistics
The summary statistics shown below are for the dataset as a whole and suggests that the design specifications are being met.

However, when we group the data by lot, as shown below, we see that manufactuing lot 3 is not up to standards. Lot 3 has a variance of ~170psi which is above the 100psi threshold.
